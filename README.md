# JUIT-GPT
A GPT chatbot for University.

### Motivation behind JUIT-GPT
Generative AI is a game changer for our society, but adoption in companies of all sizes and data-sensitive
domains like healthcare or legal is limited by a clear concern: **privacy**.
Not being able to ensure that your data is fully under your control when using third-party AI tools
is a risk those industries cannot take.

This project has been strongly influenced and supported by other amazing projects like 
[LangChain](https://github.com/hwchase17/langchain),
[GPT4All](https://github.com/nomic-ai/gpt4all),
